### CT2: Preprocessing Steps for Text Manipulation in Machine Learning

In this activity, we will Define and illustrate typical preprocessing procedures in Machine Learning for text manipulation. 
Following that is a Python program example that loads a text into memory as strings, splits strings into tokens, 
and builds a vocabulary table to map the divided tokens to number indices.
